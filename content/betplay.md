  <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The newcomers Betplay.io have only been up and running for a short time.
      Despite being a new casino in the casino sphere, you can’t tell from the website’s structure and
      graphics. Upon entering Betplay.io you are greeted by a simple and fuzz-free homepage, clearly stating
      the casino’s strengths and focus points. There are no unnecessary flashy animations flying around or a

  </ul>
  <h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Casino</span></h2>
  <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Betplay is what we call a “pure” casino. Offering nothing but casino-ish
      games. They have an extensive list of game suppliers and a search feature where you can easily
      <strong>search for the game</strong> you are looking for. You may already have a favorite game provider,
      in that case use the filter function to only show the games made by them.&nbsp;</span></p>
  <h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Slots/Table games</span></h3>
  <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the casino section, you can choose between your favorite casino games,
      <a href="https://cryptocasinos.com/bitcoin-slots/">slots</a>, or table games. The list of game providers
      is truly extensive as well as the number of games offered. Most of the classic slots can be found here,
      including one of our all-time favorites “Starburst”.&nbsp;</span></p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Under the “Table games” category you can find the classics like roulette,
      blackjack, and baccarat. <strong>There are more than a few options</strong> for all of these casino
      games. The rules may differ or it’s simply games from different providers, giving you the option to find
      one with the right design or feel that suits you.</span></p>

  <h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Live casino</span></h3>
  <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Betplay, like pretty much every casino nowadays, has a live casino
      section. A good option if you want to play live casino is to play at <a
        href="https://cryptocasinos.com/Stake/">Stake</a>. Here, you can yet again find all the popular table
      games, like blackjack or roulette. Since they <strong>use a big pool of providers</strong> you can find
      pretty much anything here. Even options for live dealing games in <strong>different languages</strong>.
      We’re lacking nothing in this category.&nbsp;</span></p>
  <h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Aviator (crash)</span></h3>
  <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Crash games are one of the most recent features from casinos. On
      Betplay.io this is called “Aviator”. The game is played by wagering an amount of your choice. There’s a
      multiplier that will gradually increase until eventually crashing at a random moment. Your objective is
      to press the cashout button before this happens, securing yourself a win. Very addictive and fast-paced.
      Not for the fainthearted.</span></p>
  <h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mobile casino</span></h2>
  <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Betplay can be played in your <a
        href="https://cryptocasinos.com/#item-12">mobile</a> device’s web browser, but the recommended option
      is to download the casinos app. In the app, you can access everything that you’ll find on their original
      website optimized for your device.</span></p>
  <h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bonus options</span></h2>
  <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Betplay offers the industry standard of a <strong>100% matched welcome
        bonus on your first deposit</strong> with a wagering requirement of 35x. For example: If you deposit
      10 mBTCs, you will receive a bonus of 10 mBTCs, after having wagered 350 mBTCs in the casino’s
      games.</span></p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Betplay.io also offers rakeback and cashback.&nbsp;</span><b></b></p>
  <ul>
    <li aria-level="1"><b>Daily rakeback</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> An amount of what you have
        wagered in the casino will be paid back to your account every day. As expected the amount paid back is
        determined by how much you have wagered. Payouts are done daily and automatically to your
        balance.</span></li>
    <li aria-level="1"><b>10% weekly cashback</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Fridays are a little bit
        more fun than any other day of the week at Betplay. 10% of any losses during the past week will be
        paid out automatically to your account. We don’t mind some of that free cash. Another casino that
        offers cash back is <a href="https://cryptocasinos.com/stake/">Stake</a>.</span></li>
  </ul>
  <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In order to be eligible for rakeback and cashback you need to have
      reached the VIP level of bronze. How much is paid out is determined by a couple of different factors
      like wager size, game type, and VIP level. In order to check where you’re at in your progress, navigate
      to the profile menu and click “VIP level”.&nbsp;</span></p>
  <h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Banking</span></h2>
  <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Betplay.io as well as casinos like <a
        href="https://cryptocasinos.com/stake/">Stake</a> and <a
        href="https://cryptocasinos.com/bitstarz/">Bitstarz</a> are clearly <strong>crypto focused</strong>
      <strong>casinos</strong>. They offer many different options for deposits and withdrawals. <a
        href="https://cryptocasinos.com/news/what-is-bitcoin/">Bitcoin</a>, <a
        href="https://cryptocasinos.com/news/what-is-tether/">tether</a>, <a
        href="https://cryptocasinos.com/news/what-is-litecoin/">litecoin</a>, ripple, Binance USD, and
      dogecoin are a couple of these.&nbsp;</span></p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Betplay has put energy into making the banking aspect of playing on their
      website as easy as possible. To speed up transactions, Betplay accepts deposits and withdrawals through
      Bitcoin Lightning.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">&nbsp;The name is quite telling, promising
      transactions in a matter of seconds. Not only deposits but also withdrawals are done instantly. Instant
      deposits are something we highly value at <a href="https://cryptocasinos.com/">Crypto Casinos</a>! They
      say that they are the only casino to offer this feature currently on the market. We’re not so sure about
      this. Big operators like <a href="https://cryptocasinos.com/bitcasino/">Bitcasino</a> and <a
        href="https://cryptocasinos.com/stake/">Stake</a> also offer this to their players.&nbsp; On top of
      the transactions being done almost instantly, the fees are close to zero when using Lightning. Check
      your </span><a href="https://cryptocasinos.com/#item-9"><span style="font-weight: 400;">crypto
        wallet</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to see if it supports “Bitcoin lightning”. Betplay
      themselves recommend “Blue wallet” for android users and “Wallet of satoshi” for iPhone users if you
      wish to try lightning.</span></p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You can also deposit bitcoin in the regular way by sending them to the
      casino’s BTC address or scanning a generated QR code.</span></p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Litecoin is deposited similarly by selecting mLTC as currency and then
      sending a desired amount to the address shown.&nbsp;</span></p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There are options for depositing using credit cards and bank transfers.
      Navigate to “Buy Micro-Bitcoin” and follow the instructions.&nbsp;</span></p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Betplay.io has no minimum amount required for deposits or
      withdrawals.</span></p>
  <h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Conclusion</span></h2>
  <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Betplay.io may be new but you couldn’t tell when browsing their website.
      It’s obvious that the team behind the casino are very serious about trying to climb the rankings in the
      casino sphere, quickly. Not many casinos offer this well of a developed and thought through casino at
      launch. <strong>Game selection is more than extensive</strong> within casino games. Offering perhaps one
      of the most important features for the player, fast transactions, in both ways. The casino layout looks
      good on a computer and just as good on your mobile device, they even have an app. Operating without a
      licence may be preferred to some players who wish to remain anonymous when gambling but not to
      others.</span></p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Going back to the question if we can approve this casino.<strong> A
        simple “yay” </strong>will do for now and the future of Betplay.io is looking just as bright as the
      future of cryptos overall. To the moon!</span></p>
