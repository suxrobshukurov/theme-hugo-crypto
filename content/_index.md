    <h3>Advantages of crypto &amp; bitcoin gambling</h3>
    <p>Online casinos have to deal with <strong>one new regulation after another</strong>, which has
      made payment transactions a very tightly regulated process. This is where bitcoin and other
      cryptocurrencies have come to the rescue.</p>
    <p>In short, cryptocurrencies provide an alternative way to process payments on casino sites without
      the restrictions that come with fiat currency processing. But that isn’t the only advantage when
      it comes to cryptocurrencies and the blockchain.</p>
    <h4>Decentralization</h4>
    <p>One of the advantages we like best here at CryptoCasinos is that virtual currencies such as
      Bitcoin are <strong>decentralized</strong>. This means that they have no connection with
      governments or banks at all, which puts you in complete control of your funds. They can’t be
      blocked, and your account can’t be frozen. Not only that, while playing at a bitcoin casino, you
      can transfer your funds to a <a href="https://cryptocasinos.com/#item-9">crypto
        wallet</a>&nbsp;without anyone watching.</p>
    <h4>Transaction Fees</h4>
    <p>Any e-commerce company needs to make money, and one way to do that is through the transferral of
      funds i.e., each time a customer makes either a deposit or withdrawal. Conventional payment
      methods tend to come with high fees at online casinos, as they do anywhere else. Fortunately,
      blockchain transaction fees are far lower than these conventional methods, meaning that you get
      to<strong> keep more of the money you win</strong> than you would at a standard online casino.
      More money in your pocket means that you can play for longer.</p>
    <h4>Verification</h4>
    <p>Another advantage of cryptocurrency is <strong>transparency</strong>. An example of how this is
      particularly helpful lies in the fact that, due to the public ledger, your transactions are
      visible. This means you can prove you made a payment and verify that your withdrawal was made by
      the bitcoin or crypto casino.</p>
    <h4>Worldwide Acceptance</h4>
    <p>One of the goals of cryptocurrencies is to provide a worldwide payment system without any
      involvement or control from either a bank or a government. Without this national and institutional
      control, this means that Bitcoin or any other cryptocurrency works exactly the same for all
      Bitcoin gambling sites, <strong>regardless of which country you reside in</strong>. Our top
      casinos accept players from the US.</p>
    <h4>Anonymity</h4>
    <p>Bitcoin is pseudonymous, so your personal data remains hidden throughout a transaction. Yes, the
      transition can be viewed by all, but it’s only the amount that’s visible. Some bitcoin casino
      sites offer <strong>fully anonymous</strong> accounts, which means that you can play your favorite
      games <strong>without revealing any of your personal data at all.</strong> Oh, and transactions
      made at a Bitcoin casino will <strong>never</strong> be recorded on your credit card or bank
      account statements.</p>

    <h3>Disadvantages of crypto &amp; bitcoin gambling</h3>
    <p>Like with anything else, whenever there are advantages there are also disadvantages. Some people
      are often put off by the opportunity to try something new, even when there are numerous benefits
      in them doing so. To give you the full picture so you can make up your own mind, here are a few
      things you should take into account if you’re considering playing with cryptocurrency.</p>
    <h4>No recourse</h4>
    <p>As no-one owns the blockchain, if you run into a problem with a transaction, you’ll struggle to
      get it resolved. While you may get a certain level of customer support from either your wallet
      provider or the crypto casino itself, they have no control over the blockchain. Added to that, if
      the funds in your crypto wallet are subject to theft, they would be untraceable, and you would
      have only a slim chance of getting them back. We look at it this way: this only reaffirms why you
      should use a decent crypto wallet and ensure that your funds are properly secured. Of course, this
      is one of the areas we’ve covered right here in <a href="https://cryptocasinos.com/#wallet">this
        guide</a>.</p>
    <h4>No chargebacks/reversals</h4>
    <p>Once a transaction has been confirmed, the funds have left your wallet. So if there is a problem
      with the casino, you have no way to chargeback or reverse the charge as you might do with a credit
      card. This is just one reason why you should <strong>only play at</strong> <strong>reputable
        bitcoin and crypto casinos, like the ones we at CryptoCasinos recommend.</strong></p>
    <h4>Volatility</h4>
    <p>Another thing that cryptocurrencies are famous for is their volatility, which can lead to a
      <strong>high amount of fluctuation</strong>. While this can be an advantage, such as if the value
      of Bitcoin increases, it can also work the opposite way.
    </p>
    <p>If you play at a Bitcoin casino in BTC, the volatility only affects you when you exchange your
      coins back into a fiat currency. If the site you’re playing at converts your coins into fiat
      currency, they may lose some value during the conversions. On the flip side, of course, you could
      just as likely find that they <strong>gain in value</strong>. So there’s that!</p>

    <h3>How to choose a crypto/bitcoin casino?</h3>
    <p>Here at CryptoCasinos, our team of experts have taken care of finding the very best crypto
      casinos out there. Of course, which crypto casino you choose to play at depends on your personal
      preferences. Our reviews include information for each of the following points to help you find the
      right casino for you.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>If you have a preference for a <strong>particular cryptocurrency</strong>, you should check
        that any crypto casino you’re considering playing at accepts your preferred coins.</li>
      <li>You’ll also want to look at the <strong>catalog of games</strong> on offer. If you’re not
        looking for casino games, you should check out our guides for <a
          href="https://www.cryptobetting.com/">crypto betting</a>, <a
          href="https://cryptocasinos.com/bitcoin-lottery/">lottery,</a> <a
          href="https://cryptocasinos.com/bitcoin-dice/">dice</a> and <a
          href="https://cryptocasinos.com/bitcoin-poker/">poker</a>.</li>
      <li>Take a good look at the <strong>various bonuses</strong> on offer. Some bitcoin casinos offer
        free spins, others offer a matched bonus, and sometimes you’ll find a combination of the two. We
        don’t suggest that you let this sway your decision too much, as bonuses only offer a short-term
        advantage. However, if you find that two bitcoin casinos offer similar advantages, it only makes
        sense to go for the one with the best bonus.</li>
      <li>Take a look at the restricted countries for the casino you’re looking to play at. This can be
        done by visiting our review page for the casino and looking at the highlights, for example, a
        site that accepts US players will say “Players from USA Accepted”, which means that this is a
        bitcoin casino for USA based players.</li>
    </ul>

        <p>Among the main reasons why Bitcoin has become so popular lies in its safety when making
          transactions. To access the funds in your crypto wallet, an individual would require your
          login details including the two-step verification. That’s just one of the reasons why hacking
          is <strong>extremely difficult</strong> when it comes to cryptocurrency.</p>
      </div>
    </div>
    <h4>Choosing reputable sites</h4>
    <p>This might seem like an obvious point, but sticking to reputable sites is the easiest and safest
      way to choose a bitcoin casino. Looking at a site’s reputation through sites like <a
        href="https://www.trustpilot.com/">TrustPilot</a> gives you an idea of how the bitcoin casino
      has been doing in the past, but also how it’s doing now. While a site’s reputation doesn’t
      necessarily correlate to its future, it’s often an indication of how they’ve dealt with customers
      in the past and how they treat their players. All the sites that are listed on our top lists have
      had their reputation and license checked by our team of reviewers – so that you don’t have to.
      Hopefully, this will save you a lot of time so that you can enjoy the games online instead of
      doing the research yourself.&nbsp;</p>
    <h4>Passwords</h4>
    <p>You should always choose a strong password when you sign up for anything online, but that’s even
      more so the case when financial transactions are involved. So you’ll want to think of a password
      that’s <strong>both secure and unique</strong> when creating an account with a bitcoin casino.</p>
    <p>You should create a password that includes upper case and lower letters, special characters, and
      numbers. You may have noticed that many sites give you no choice these days. Also, choose a
      <strong>unique password for each crypto casino</strong> you register with if you’re signing up for
      multiple casinos. One final tip on this: change your password periodically, and never share it
      with anyone. Using software that randomizes your password on signup and remembers it could also be
      a viable choice, as it removes any risk of you ever getting hit by a keylogger. A good option for
      this is <a href="https://passwords.google.com/">Google Password Manager</a>.
    </p>
    <h4>Trusted exchange</h4>
    <p>Some exchanges are more reputable than others. When you purchase your virtual coins, you should
      choose a <strong>trusted crypto exchange</strong> like Bitfinex, Coinbase, or Binance. We also
      recommend you avoid buying coins from anyone over a forum. You wouldn’t know who you were dealing
      with, and you may find that they fail to deliver on their promise.</p>

    <h3>Crypto &amp; bitcoin casino bonuses</h3>
    <p>Both fiat-currency and crypto &amp; bitcoin casino sites are known for offering a range of
      generous bonuses. So you’ll want to make sure you at least understand the basic terms before you
      commit to accepting any bonuses. Here are some of the main types of bonuses offered by the top
      crypto casinos.</p>
    <h4>Deposit bonuses</h4>
    <p>What is a crypto casino deposit bonus? Two primary bonus types are deposit match and no-deposit
      bonuses. A deposit match is the one you’ll see most often. It’s a match percentage bonus, with the
      bonus value based on your first deposit, up to a certain amount e.g., 100% match bonus up to 5
      BTC. Simply put, this means that if you deposit 5 BTC the casino will match your deposit, putting
      your total at 10 BTC.</p>
    <p>At the moment both <a href="https://cryptocasinos.com/betplay/">Betplay.io</a> and <a
        href="https://cryptocasinos.com/cloudbet/">Cloudbet</a> are offering 100% up to 5 BTC deposit
      bonuses.&nbsp;</p>
    <p>Some bitcoin casino sites offer a more comprehensive match bonus, which rewards you when you make
      your first few deposits, as opposed to just the first one. These are always worth taking a second
      look at as it means you will benefit from the offer for longer.</p>
    <h4>No-deposit bonuses</h4>
    <p>What is a bitcoin casino no-deposit bonus? A no-deposit bonus is a rare bonus offered by crypto
      and bitcoin casinos. The basic idea is that it’s a bonus that<strong> doesn’t require a deposit to
        be claimed.</strong> No deposit bonuses are usually much smaller than traditional welcome
      bonuses. This makes sense, as it doesn’t require any kind of financial commitment. All you need to
      do to claim this bonus is open an account, and you’ll receive your no-deposit bonus just for
      giving the casino a try. No-deposit bonuses are usually the most popular among players when it
      comes to bonuses and promotions.</p>
    <h4>Free spins</h4>
    <p>As an alternative to a match bonus, free spins are awarded either as part of a welcome bonus, or
      exclusively as an incentive for making your first deposit. In some cases, they’re offered in the
      form of a non-deposit bonus i.e., without requiring you to make a deposit at all.</p>
    <h4>No-wagering bonuses</h4>
    <p>A no-wagering bonus is a bonus without a wagering requirement. This means that the bonus can be
      claimed, used and then withdrawn, without any requirements for how many times the bonus amount is
      used in play. These bonuses, along with the no-deposit bonuses, are the most popular bonuses a
      crypto &amp; bitcoin casino can offer to their players.</p>
    <h4>Reload bonuses</h4>
    <p>A lot of casinos also offer reload bonuses, which are bonuses for players that “reload”, meaning
      deposit more than once. These are especially popular at crypto and bitcoin casinos, as a lot of
      bitcoin users like to deposit more than once. These bonuses are much like the regular welcome
      bonuses and usually has similar wagering requirements etc.</p>
    <h4>Cashback</h4>
    <p>Lately more and more crypto casinos have begun to offer Cashback which seems to be a very popular
      offer amongst players.&nbsp; Cashback means that you’ll get back a percentage of your
      losses.&nbsp;</p>
    <p>The <strong>best crypto casinos with cashback</strong> currently are, <a
        href="https://cryptocasinos.com/stake/">Stake</a> and <a

        <p>Bitcoin is clearly the most well-known and most popular virtual currency. So much so that
          some casinos only accept Bitcoin. Although, there’s an increasing number of them are offering
          other cryptocurrencies.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Regardless of which cryptocurrency you have a preference for, you’re almost certain to find
          it at multiple of our recommended crypto &amp; bitcoin gambling sites. Here are some of the
          most commonly offered coins accepted at online casinos.</p>
      </div>
    </div>
    <h4>Bitcoin (BTC)</h4>
    <p>Bitcoin isn’t the fastest of the payment methods available, but it more than makes up for it when
      it comes to safety. Considering that the network governs itself, the safety of the currency is
      second to none. It’s one of the traits that users value the most in the coin, and is a major part
      of its success.</p>
    <p>Although, perhaps the most important characteristic of Bitcoin is decentralization. Players all
      over the world can deposit funds without any government intervention or middle man involved.</p>
    <p>When all is said and done, <strong>Bitcoin is the most popular crypto for online
        casinos</strong>, and that looks unlikely to change in the foreseeable future.</p>
    <h4>Ethereum (ETH)</h4>
    <p><strong>The most popular crypto after bitcoin is Ethereum.</strong> Some online casinos only
      accept the coin because of this fact. Players can make deposits faster at an Ethereum casino than
      they can at a Bitcoin casino. The fees that come along with this crypto are generally noticeably
      smaller than those for bitcoin.</p>
    <p>Where Ethereum falls down in comparison with Bitcoin is in the fact that it’s less secure.
      Regardless, it remains a great option for making deposits at online casinos. This is even truer
      when it comes to its cheap and fast transactions.</p>
    <h4>Bitcoin Cash</h4>
    <p>While it’s a Bitcoin offshoot, it shares the same basic principles as its (sort of) namesake.
      Bitcoin Cash was developed as a way of overcoming the shortcomings of Bitcoin. Developers worked
      with the Bitcoin code and applied advanced technology to handle issues such as slow transaction
      times. Bitcoin Cash is popular with online crypto casinos due to its user-friendliness and speed.
    </p>
    <h4>Litecoin (LTC)</h4>
    <p>Litecoin has been around since 2011. Also known as an altcoin, it shares a number of features
      with Bitcoin, but with its own distinct benefits. It’s also cheaper and faster than Bitcoin.
      Buying Litecoin to top up your crypto casino balance gives you top-level anonymity and security.
      The coin is used all over the world and also delivers speedy payment processing.</p>

    <h3>Crypto wallets</h3>
    <p>There are a number of options when it comes to crypto wallets. Most wallets nowadays are very

    <ul>
      <li>Coinbase</li>

    <h3>How to deposit and withdraw funds</h3>
    <p><strong>Making a deposit at a crypto or bitcoin casino is perfectly safe.</strong> Each payment
      transaction is added to the ledger that is available to be viewed publicly. Thanks to this
      advanced technology, it’s close to impossible for scam artists such as identity thieves to apply
      any underhanded methods to the blockchain.</p>
    <h4>Making a bitcoin casino deposit</h4>
    <p>Before you start having fun with crypto gambling, you’ll need to have already purchased your
      virtual currency and have stored it in an e-wallet. Here are the steps you need to take:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Step 1.</strong> Log in to your favorite crypto or bitcoin casino and visit the
        cashier</li>
      <li><strong>Step 2.</strong>&nbsp;Select a cryptocurrency</li>
      <li><strong>Step 3.</strong>&nbsp;Choose a crypto wallet</li>
      <li><strong>Step 4.</strong>&nbsp;Enter the amount you want to deposit</li>
    </ul>
    <p>If this is your first deposit, make sure to accept the welcome bonus, if offered. Finally, enjoy
      playing your chosen selection of bitcoin games.</p>
    <h4>Making a bitcoin casino instant withdrawal</h4>
    <p>Making an instant withdrawal at a bitcoin casino is just as simple as with any other casino.
      Before you make a withdrawal at a crypto casino, you’ll need to make sure that you’ve fulfilled
      any wagering requirements, especially if you’ve used your bonus funds. Withdrawing funds to your
      wallet is as easy as the following.</p>
    <ul>
      <li><b>Step 1. </b>Visit the cashier and choose your preferred method of withdrawal</li>
      <li><strong>Step 2. </strong>Enter the amount you wish to withdraw and confirm the withdrawal
        request</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Keep in mind that all bitcoin casino withdrawals are not instant, so make sure the casino you’re
      playing at has this functionality if it’s something you want.</p>

    <h3>Most popular games at bitcoin casinos</h3>
    <p>Crypto gambling games aren’t that different from those you’ll find at other online casinos. Of
      course, not all casinos offer the same library of titles. Generally, however, you can expect to
      use your crypto coins to play the most popular casino games, such as:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Slots</li>
      <li>Video <a href="https://cryptocasinos.com/bitcoin-poker/">poker</a></li>
      <li>Blackjack</li>
      <li>Roulette</li>
      <li>Craps</li>
      <li>Live casino</li>
      <li>Dice</li>
      <li>VR Casino</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Mobile bitcoin casinos</h3>
    <p>It’s commonplace these days for almost everything on the web to offer a mobile version.
      Fortunately, that includes Bitcoin gambling sites. While many casinos have developed apps you can
      download onto your mobile device, many others have taken the mobile-optimized approach to their
      website. What this means is that you can play numerous bitcoin games from the casino’s portfolio
      on your mobile browser while saving space on your phone that would otherwise be taken up by an
      app.</p>
    <p>If you play on a mobile device, you’ll, of course, need to deposit your virtual coins and be able
      to access your digital wallet. So you should download your wallet onto your device, or at least
      know your key, for when you make a deposit. If you started off using your desktop but want to play
      the same casino using your phone, there’s no need to make another deposit, the wallet and bonuses
      used on the desktop can generally be used on mobile just the same.</p>

    <h3>Provably fair casinos</h3>
    <p>A provably fair bitcoin casino confirms the fairness of a game in real time, which makes checking
      via manual auditing unnecessary. <strong>All casinos listed on our sites have provably fair
        games.</strong></p>
    <h4>How to know if a casino is provably fair</h4>
    <p>When starting a provably fair game, you’ll receive a hashed seed number, and you’ll have the
      ability to add your own seed. Once the <a href="https://cryptocasinos.com/bitcoin-betting/">bet</a>
      has been played, you will be given the
      seed that was used in the bet. If the hash wasn’t touched in any way, the game can be considered
      to be fair and random.</p>
    <p>A provably fair game allows you to verify that a game’s outcome is random and untouched. It’s a
      clever and technologically advanced way of ensuring that a game provides a <strong>fair and safe
        experience for crypto players</strong>. When provably fair games have been established, it
      enhances fairness, transparency, and trust. It’s just one of the many things we love about Bitcoin
      casinos.</p>

    <h3>Step by step: how to get started at a bitcoin casino</h3>
    <p>Now that you have all the information you need, it’s easy to start playing at a crypto casino.
      Just follow these three steps:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Step 1. </strong>The first thing you need to do is find an exchange to buy your
        virtual coins from. There are a number of reputable exchanges that provide cryptocurrency
        services, so choose one and make your purchase. We just want to make you aware that different
        exchanges offer different cryptocurrencies, so if you have a preference for a coin such as <a
          href="https://cryptocasinos.com/news/what-is-litecoin/">Litecoin</a>, please find an exchange
        that sells that particular coin.</li>
      <li><strong>Step 2.</strong> Once you’ve purchased your coins, you’ll need to find a crypto wallet
        to store your coins in and keep them safe. In the meantime, you can keep your coins in the
        exchange from which your coins were purchased. Longer-term, however, you should store your coins
        in your own wallet, in order to have more control over your currency.<br>
        Some crypto and bitcoin casinos sell virtual coins, which means that you can go straight to the
        casino. You can even do so just before you’re ready to start playing. Just make sure you know
        which casino you want to play at before you sign up and provide your payment details.</li>
      <li><strong>Step 3.</strong> Once you’ve bought your coins and are happy that you have them stored
        in a safe place, it’s time to choose your casino. Remember that we’ve already done the
        groundwork for you by providing the very best online crypto casinos. So you just need to decide
        which one is right for you, create your account, and have fun playing your favorite casino
        bitcoin games.</li>
    </ul>
