<h2>How do we rate online casinos?<h2>
<p>As long-time gamblers, we’ve found a process to effectively analyze, review and rank casinos based on a number of factors. We’ve all learned to be wary of what casinos say, and what they’re actually able to deliver. That’s why we anonymously sign up, deposit, and play at each casino that’s ranked on our site before analyzing and reviewing it. By staying anonymous throughout the process we’re able to mimic the experience our users will have when signing up as closely as possible. We’ll tell you all about what casinos to stay away from and guide you to the safe havens of licensed casinos you can trust. By reading our reviews you will have a safe online gambling experience and know that your crypto is safe.  Here are some of the factors that we value when reviewing casinos:</p>

{{< img-col/right-text >}} <h3 class="mb-0 mb-lg-30">Security, licensing and provably fair</h3><p>Crypto casinos are generally known to be <b>safer and more secure than most regular casinos, but this doesn't mean that all crypto casinos are safe.</b> For a site to be considered trustworthy and reputable, it has to have the proper security measures and licenses in place. Licenses are dispensed by gaming authorities such as MGA, UKGC, Curacao and many more. Sites that are licensed are held to a high standard when it comes to being provably fair, handling of details, fair and proper bonuses and everything else that makes a site trustworthy and reputable. Our reviewers go through and check each individual license to make sure that it's valid and verifiable. We also make sure that the sites have proper security measures, such as SSL 128-bit encryption to protect your details, a proper payment system and additional security options such as two-step verification.</p>{{</ img-col/right-text >}}

{{< img-col/left-text >}} <h3 class="mb-0 mb-lg-30">Cryptocurrencies accepted</h3><p>It might seem obvious, but it's essential that the crypto casinos on our lists accept a large number of cryptocurrencies. While most users stick to the more well-known currencies such as <a href="https://cryptocasinos.com/news/what-is-bitcoin/">Bitcoin</a>, we never want to limit players to these currencies. <b>That's why each casino has to have at least three cryptocurrencies accepted to be considered a "crypto casino".</b> The most common currencies accepted by the sites on our lists are Bitcoin, <a href="https://cryptocasinos.com/news/what-is-ethereum/">Ethereum</a>, Bitcoin Cash, and <a href="https://cryptocasinos.com/news/what-is-litecoin/">Litecoin</a>. As more and more cryptos pop up and become popular we'll increase the amount of cryptos a site needs to have to be considered a crypto casino.</p>{{</ img-col/left-text >}}

{{< img-col/right-text >}} <h3 class="mb-0 mb-lg-30">Bonuses & promotions</h3><p>There's no question that a lot of players are enticed by the bonuses and promotions offered by casinos. It's a great way to get a head start and to be able to enjoy playing at higher stakes than you regularly would, or to simply extend your casino experience by having a larger budget. We understand that Bitcoin casinos are held to a higher standard than regular casinos when it comes to bonuses and promotions, so we make sure that all casinos on our lists offer a sizeable bonus or cashback for new players. A lot of the casinos we review have also decided to offer players from CryptoCasinos a better bonus or a bigger cashback percentage than their regular welcome bonuses, so make sure to watch out for exclusive bonuses that pop up on our lists.</p>{{</ img-col/right-text >}}
