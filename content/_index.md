{{< one-col >}}<h2>How do we rate online casinos?</h2>

<p>As long-time gamblers, we’ve found a process to effectively analyze, review and rank casinos based on a number of factors. We’ve all learned to be wary of what casinos say, and what they’re actually able to deliver. That’s why we anonymously sign up, deposit, and play at each casino that’s ranked on our site before analyzing and reviewing it. By staying anonymous throughout the process we’re able to mimic the experience our users will have when signing up as closely as possible. We’ll tell you all about what casinos to stay away from and guide you to the safe havens of licensed casinos you can trust. By reading our reviews you will have a safe online gambling experience and know that your crypto is safe.  Here are some of the factors that we value when reviewing casinos:</p>
{{</ one-col >}}

{{< img-col >}}

{{< img-col/left-img >}} <amp-img width="145" height="145" alt="Security and licenses icon" src="/images/icons/security.svg"></amp-img> {{</ img-col/left-img >}}

{{< img-col/right-text >}} <h2 class="mb-0 mb-lg-30">Security, licensing and provably fair</h2><p>Crypto casinos are generally known to be <b>safer and more secure than most regular casinos, but this doesn't mean that all crypto casinos are safe.</b> For a site to be considered trustworthy and reputable, it has to have the proper security measures and licenses in place. Licenses are dispensed by gaming authorities such as MGA, UKGC, Curacao and many more. Sites that are licensed are held to a high standard when it comes to being provably fair, handling of details, fair and proper bonuses and everything else that makes a site trustworthy and reputable. Our reviewers go through and check each individual license to make sure that it's valid and verifiable. We also make sure that the sites have proper security measures, such as SSL 128-bit encryption to protect your details, a proper payment system and additional security options such as two-step verification.</p>{{</ img-col/right-text >}}

{{< img-col/right-img >}} <amp-img width="145" height="145" alt="Security and licenses icon" src="/images/icons/crypto.svg"></amp-img> {{</ img-col/right-img >}}

{{< img-col/left-text >}} <h2 class="mb-0 mb-lg-30">Cryptocurrencies accepted</h2><p>It might seem obvious, but it's essential that the crypto casinos on our lists accept a large number of cryptocurrencies. While most users stick to the more well-known currencies such as <a href="/news/what-is-bitcoin/">Bitcoin</a>, we never want to limit players to these currencies. <b>That's why each casino has to have at least three cryptocurrencies accepted to be considered a "crypto casino".</b> The most common currencies accepted by the sites on our lists are Bitcoin, <a href="/news/what-is-ethereum/">Ethereum</a>, Bitcoin Cash, and <a href="/news/what-is-litecoin/">Litecoin</a>. As more and more cryptos pop up and become popular we'll increase the amount of cryptos a site needs to have to be considered a crypto casino.</p>{{</ img-col/left-text >}}

{{</ img-col >}}

{{< img-col >}}

{{< img-col/left-img >}} <amp-img width="145" height="145" alt="Security and licenses icon" src="/images/icons/crypto-bonuses.svg"></amp-img> {{</ img-col/left-img >}}

{{< img-col/right-text >}} <h2 class="mb-0 mb-lg-30">Bonuses & promotions</h2><p>There's no question that a lot of players are enticed by the bonuses and promotions offered by casinos. It's a great way to get a head start and to be able to enjoy playing at higher stakes than you regularly would, or to simply extend your casino experience by having a larger budget. We understand that Bitcoin casinos are held to a higher standard than regular casinos when it comes to bonuses and promotions, so we make sure that all casinos on our lists offer a sizeable bonus or cashback for new players. A lot of the casinos we review have also decided to offer players from CryptoCasinos a better bonus or a bigger cashback percentage than their regular welcome bonuses, so make sure to watch out for exclusive bonuses that pop up on our lists.</p>{{</ img-col/right-text >}}

<h2> Your Guide to Crypto Casinos &amp; Bitcoin Gambling </h2>

<p>With cryptocurrencies and blockchain technology growing rapidly, and Bitcoin being at the forefront of
  this movement, <strong>CryptoCasinos</strong> has made it its mission to provide all the information you
  need to distinguish good from bad crypto &amp; bitcoin casino sites.</p>
<p>Here’s the thing: with so many <a href="/">bitcoin casinos</a> out there,
  you may be wondering where you should begin. It’s perfectly understandable if you’re feeling a bit
  overwhelmed. Which coin should you choose for playing online? What games are available? What differs
  from site to site? And so on.</p>
<p>Here, we answer those questions and look at <strong>all aspects</strong> of crypto casinos, including
  customer support, bonuses, and more. Thanks to our experienced team of researchers, we’ve made a guide
  for both new players and veterans in the bitcoin casino business. We also provide our recommendations of
  only the very best crypto &amp; bitcoin casinos out there. If casino games aren’t your thing, check out
  our <a href="/">betting</a>, <a href="/">poker</a>, and <a href="/">lottery</a> guides! For those looking for other
  languages, feel free to check
  out our <a href="/fr/">French</a>, <a href="/de/">German</a>, <a href="/sv/">Swedish</a>
  and <a href="/ja/">Japanese</a> page.</p>

  <h2>Advantages of crypto &amp; bitcoin gambling</h2>
  <p>Online casinos have to deal with <strong>one new regulation after another</strong>, which has made
    payment transactions a very tightly regulated process. This is where bitcoin and other
    cryptocurrencies have come to the rescue.</p>
  <p>In short, cryptocurrencies provide an alternative way to process payments on casino sites without the
    restrictions that come with fiat currency processing. But that isn’t the only advantage when it comes
    to cryptocurrencies and the blockchain.</p>
  <h3>Decentralization</h3>
  <p>One of the advantages we like best here at CryptoCasinos is that virtual currencies such as Bitcoin
    are <strong>decentralized</strong>. This means that they have no connection with governments or banks
    at all, which puts you in complete control of your funds. They can’t be blocked, and your account
    can’t be frozen. Not only that, while playing at a bitcoin casino, you can transfer your funds to a <a
      href="/#item-9">crypto wallet</a>&nbsp;without anyone watching.</p>
  <h3>Transaction Fees</h3>
  <p>Any e-commerce company needs to make money, and one way to do that is through the transferral of
    funds i.e., each time a customer makes either a deposit or withdrawal. Conventional payment methods
    tend to come with high fees at online casinos, as they do anywhere else. Fortunately, blockchain
    transaction fees are far lower than these conventional methods, meaning that you get to<strong> keep
      more of the money you win</strong> than you would at a standard online casino. More money in your
    pocket means that you can play for longer.</p>
  <h3>Verification</h3>
  <p>Another advantage of cryptocurrency is <strong>transparency</strong>. An example of how this is
    particularly helpful lies in the fact that, due to the public ledger, your transactions are visible.
    This means you can prove you made a payment and verify that your withdrawal was made by the bitcoin or
    crypto casino.</p>
  <h3>Worldwide Acceptance</h3>
  <p>One of the goals of cryptocurrencies is to provide a worldwide payment system without any involvement
    or control from either a bank or a government. Without this national and institutional control, this
    means that Bitcoin or any other cryptocurrency works exactly the same for all Bitcoin gambling sites,
    <strong>regardless of which country you reside in</strong>. Our top casinos accept players from the
    US.
  </p>
  <h3>Anonymity</h3>
  <p>Bitcoin is pseudonymous, so your personal data remains hidden throughout a transaction. Yes, the
    transition can be viewed by all, but it’s only the amount that’s visible. Some bitcoin casino sites
    offer <strong>fully anonymous</strong> accounts, which means that you can play your favorite games
    <strong>without revealing any of your personal data at all.</strong> Oh, and transactions made at a
    Bitcoin casino will <strong>never</strong> be recorded on your credit card or bank account statements.
  </p>
<amp-img alt="Bitcoin Fact 1" width="1" height="0.12" class="mt-lg-20 mt-10 mb-lg-40 mb-40" src="/images/icons/Bitcoinfact1.svg" layout="responsive"></amp-img>

  <h2>Disadvantages of crypto &amp; bitcoin gambling</h2>
  <p>Like with anything else, whenever there are advantages there are also disadvantages. Some people are
    often put off by the opportunity to try something new, even when there are numerous benefits in them
    doing so. To give you the full picture so you can make up your own mind, here are a few things you
    should take into account if you’re considering playing with cryptocurrency.</p>
  <h3>No recourse</h3>
  <p>As no-one owns the blockchain, if you run into a problem with a transaction, you’ll struggle to get
    it resolved. While you may get a certain level of customer support from either your wallet provider or
    the crypto casino itself, they have no control over the blockchain. Added to that, if the funds in
    your crypto wallet are subject to theft, they would be untraceable, and you would have only a slim
    chance of getting them back. We look at it this way: this only reaffirms why you should use a decent
    crypto wallet and ensure that your funds are properly secured. Of course, this is one of the areas
    we’ve covered right here in <a href="#wallet">this guide</a>.</p>
  <h3>No chargebacks/reversals</h3>
  <p>Once a transaction has been confirmed, the funds have left your wallet. So if there is a problem with
    the casino, you have no way to chargeback or reverse the charge as you might do with a credit card.
    This is just one reason why you should <strong>only play at</strong> <strong>reputable bitcoin and
      crypto casinos, like the ones we at CryptoCasinos recommend.</strong></p>
  <h3>Volatility</h3>
  <p>Another thing that cryptocurrencies are famous for is their volatility, which can lead to a
    <strong>high amount of fluctuation</strong>. While this can be an advantage, such as if the value of
    Bitcoin increases, it can also work the opposite way.
  </p>
  <p>If you play at a Bitcoin casino in BTC, the volatility only affects you when you exchange your coins
    back into a fiat currency. If the site you’re playing at converts your coins into fiat currency, they
    may lose some value during the conversions. On the flip side, of course, you could just as likely find
    that they <strong>gain in value</strong>. So there’s that!</p>


  <h2>How to choose a crypto/bitcoin casino?</h2>
  <p>Here at CryptoCasinos, our team of experts have taken care of finding the very best crypto casinos
    out there. Of course, which crypto casino you choose to play at depends on your personal preferences.
    Our reviews include information for each of the following points to help you find the right casino for
    you.</p>
  <ul>
    <li>If you have a preference for a <strong>particular cryptocurrency</strong>, you should check that
      any crypto casino you’re considering playing at accepts your preferred coins.</li>
    <li>You’ll also want to look at the <strong>catalog of games</strong> on offer. If you’re not looking
      for casino games, you should check out our guides for <a href="/">crypto betting</a>,
      <a href="/">lottery,</a>
      <a href="/">dice</a> and <a href="/">poker</a>.
    </li>
    <li>Take a good look at the <strong>various bonuses</strong> on offer. Some bitcoin casinos offer free
      spins, others offer a matched bonus, and sometimes you’ll find a combination of the two. We don’t
      suggest that you let this sway your decision too much, as bonuses only offer a short-term advantage.
      However, if you find that two bitcoin casinos offer similar advantages, it only makes sense to go
      for the one with the best bonus.</li>
    <li>Take a look at the restricted countries for the casino you’re looking to play at. This can be done
      by visiting our review page for the casino and looking at the highlights, for example, a site that
      accepts US players will say “Players from USA Accepted”, which means that this is a bitcoin casino
      for USA based players.</li>
  </ul>


  <h2>Staying safe while bitcoin gambling</h2>

  <amp-img width="75" height="70" alt="Safety Icon" class="floating m-20 float-right"
    src="/images/icons/Safety-Icon-large.webp" ></amp-img>
  <p>Among the main reasons why Bitcoin has become so popular lies in its safety when making
    transactions. To access the funds in your crypto wallet, an individual would require your login
    details including the two-step verification. That’s just one of the reasons why hacking is
    <strong>extremely difficult</strong> when it comes to cryptocurrency.
  </p>

  
  <h3>Choosing reputable sites</h3>
  <p>This might seem like an obvious point, but sticking to reputable sites is the easiest and safest way
    to choose a bitcoin casino. Looking at a site’s reputation through sites like <a
      href="/">TrustPilot</a> gives you an idea of how the bitcoin casino has
    been doing in the past, but also how it’s doing now. While a site’s reputation doesn’t necessarily
    correlate to its future, it’s often an indication of how they’ve dealt with customers in the past and
    how they treat their players. All the sites that are listed on our top lists have had their reputation
    and license checked by our team of reviewers – so that you don’t have to. Hopefully, this will save
    you a lot of time so that you can enjoy the games online instead of doing the research yourself.&nbsp;
  </p>
  <h3>Passwords</h3>
  <p>You should always choose a strong password when you sign up for anything online, but that’s even more
    so the case when financial transactions are involved. So you’ll want to think of a password that’s
    <strong>both secure and unique</strong> when creating an account with a bitcoin casino.
  </p>
  <p>You should create a password that includes upper case and lower letters, special characters, and
    numbers. You may have noticed that many sites give you no choice these days. Also, choose a
    <strong>unique password for each crypto casino</strong> you register with if you’re signing up for
    multiple casinos. One final tip on this: change your password periodically, and never share it with
    anyone. Using software that randomizes your password on signup and remembers it could also be a viable
    choice, as it removes any risk of you ever getting hit by a keylogger. A good option for this is <a
      href="#">Google Password Manager</a>.
  </p>
  <h3>Trusted exchange</h3>
  <p>Some exchanges are more reputable than others. When you purchase your virtual coins, you should
    choose a <strong>trusted crypto exchange</strong> like Bitfinex, Coinbase, or Binance. We also
    recommend you avoid buying coins from anyone over a forum. You wouldn’t know who you were dealing
    with, and you may find that they fail to deliver on their promise.</p>

<amp-img alt="Bitcoin Casino Fact 2" width="1" height="0.18" class="mt-lg-20 mt-10 mb-lg-40 mb-40" src="/images/icons/Bitcoin-Casino-Fact-2-5.svg" layout="responsive"></amp-img>

  <h2>Crypto &amp; bitcoin casino bonuses</h2>
  <p>Both fiat-currency and crypto &amp; bitcoin casino sites are known for offering a range of generous
    bonuses. So you’ll want to make sure you at least understand the basic terms before you commit to
    accepting any bonuses. Here are some of the main types of bonuses offered by the top crypto casinos.
  </p>
  <h3>Deposit bonuses</h3>
  <p>What is a crypto casino deposit bonus? Two primary bonus types are deposit match and no-deposit
    bonuses. A deposit match is the one you’ll see most often. It’s a match percentage bonus, with the
    bonus value based on your first deposit, up to a certain amount e.g., 100% match bonus up to 5 BTC.
    Simply put, this means that if you deposit 5 BTC the casino will match your deposit, putting your
    total at 10 BTC.</p>
  <p>At the moment both <a href="/betplay/">Betplay.io</a> and <a href="/cloudbet/">Cloudbet</a> are offering 100% up to
    5 BTC deposit
    bonuses.&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Some bitcoin casino sites offer a more comprehensive match bonus, which rewards you when you make
    your first few deposits, as opposed to just the first one. These are always worth taking a second look
    at as it means you will benefit from the offer for longer.</p>
  <h3>No-deposit bonuses</h3>
  <p>What is a bitcoin casino no-deposit bonus? A no-deposit bonus is a rare bonus offered by crypto and
    bitcoin casinos. The basic idea is that it’s a bonus that<strong> doesn’t require a deposit to be
      claimed.</strong> No deposit bonuses are usually much smaller than traditional welcome bonuses. This
    makes sense, as it doesn’t require any kind of financial commitment. All you need to do to claim this
    bonus is open an account, and you’ll receive your no-deposit bonus just for giving the casino a try.
    No-deposit bonuses are usually the most popular among players when it comes to bonuses and promotions.
  </p>
  <h3>Free spins</h3>
  <p>As an alternative to a match bonus, free spins are awarded either as part of a welcome bonus, or
    exclusively as an incentive for making your first deposit. In some cases, they’re offered in the form
    of a non-deposit bonus i.e., without requiring you to make a deposit at all.</p>
  <h3>No-wagering bonuses</h3>
  <p>A no-wagering bonus is a bonus without a wagering requirement. This means that the bonus can be
    claimed, used and then withdrawn, without any requirements for how many times the bonus amount is used
    in play. These bonuses, along with the no-deposit bonuses, are the most popular bonuses a crypto &amp;
    bitcoin casino can offer to their players.</p>
  <h3>Reload bonuses</h3>
  <p>A lot of casinos also offer reload bonuses, which are bonuses for players that “reload”, meaning
    deposit more than once. These are especially popular at crypto and bitcoin casinos, as a lot of
    bitcoin users like to deposit more than once. These bonuses are much like the regular welcome bonuses
    and usually has similar wagering requirements etc.</p>
  <h3>Cashback</h3>
  <p>Lately more and more crypto casinos have begun to offer Cashback which seems to be a very popular
    offer amongst players.&nbsp; Cashback means that you’ll get back a percentage of your losses.&nbsp;
  </p>
  <p>The <strong>best crypto casinos with cashback</strong> currently are, <a href="/stake/">Stake</a> and <a
      href="/bitcasino/">Bitcasino.io</a></p>


  <h2>Most popular cryptos accepted by crypto casinos</h2>

  <amp-img width="76" height="70" alt="Crypto Bonuses Icon"
    class="floating m-20 float-right  lazyloading"
    src="/images/icons/Bonus-icon.webp"></amp-img>
  <p>Bitcoin is clearly the most well-known and most popular virtual currency. So much so that some
    casinos only accept Bitcoin. Although, there’s an increasing number of them are offering other
    cryptocurrencies.&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Regardless of which cryptocurrency you have a preference for, you’re almost certain to find it at
    multiple of our recommended crypto &amp; bitcoin gambling sites. Here are some of the most
    commonly offered coins accepted at online casinos.</p>
    
  
  <h3>Bitcoin (BTC)</h3>
  <p>Bitcoin isn’t the fastest of the payment methods available, but it more than makes up for it when it
    comes to safety. Considering that the network governs itself, the safety of the currency is second to
    none. It’s one of the traits that users value the most in the coin, and is a major part of its
    success.</p>
  <p>Although, perhaps the most important characteristic of Bitcoin is decentralization. Players all over
    the world can deposit funds without any government intervention or middle man involved.</p>
  <p>When all is said and done, <strong>Bitcoin is the most popular crypto for online casinos</strong>,
    and that looks unlikely to change in the foreseeable future.</p>
  <h3>Ethereum (ETH)</h3>
  <p><strong>The most popular crypto after bitcoin is Ethereum.</strong> Some online casinos only accept
    the coin because of this fact. Players can make deposits faster at an Ethereum casino than they can at
    a Bitcoin casino. The fees that come along with this crypto are generally noticeably smaller than
    those for bitcoin.</p>
  <p>Where Ethereum falls down in comparison with Bitcoin is in the fact that it’s less secure.
    Regardless, it remains a great option for making deposits at online casinos. This is even truer when
    it comes to its cheap and fast transactions.</p>
  <h3>Bitcoin Cash</h3>
  <p>While it’s a Bitcoin offshoot, it shares the same basic principles as its (sort of) namesake. Bitcoin
    Cash was developed as a way of overcoming the shortcomings of Bitcoin. Developers worked with the
    Bitcoin code and applied advanced technology to handle issues such as slow transaction times. Bitcoin
    Cash is popular with online crypto casinos due to its user-friendliness and speed.</p>
  <h3>Litecoin (LTC)</h3>
  <p>Litecoin has been around since 2011. Also known as an altcoin, it shares a number of features with
    Bitcoin, but with its own distinct benefits. It’s also cheaper and faster than Bitcoin. Buying
    Litecoin to top up your crypto casino balance gives you top-level anonymity and security. The coin is
    used all over the world and also delivers speedy payment processing.</p>


  <h2>Crypto wallets</h2>
  <p>There are a number of options when it comes to crypto wallets. Most wallets nowadays are very safe,
    especially if you stick to the most popular ones.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>These are our top 4 picks for hot wallets (online storage):</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Coinbase</li>
    <li>Binance</li>
    <li>Crypto.com</li>
    <li>Kraken</li>
  </ul>
  <p>These are our top 2 picks for cold wallets (offline storage):</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Electrum</li>
    <li>Ledger (specifically for Ledger products)</li>
  </ul>


  <h2>How to deposit and withdraw funds</h2>
  <p><strong>Making a deposit at a crypto or bitcoin casino is perfectly safe.</strong> Each payment
    transaction is added to the ledger that is available to be viewed publicly. Thanks to this advanced
    technology, it’s close to impossible for scam artists such as identity thieves to apply any
    underhanded methods to the blockchain.</p>
  <h3>Making a bitcoin casino deposit</h3>
  <p>Before you start having fun with crypto gambling, you’ll need to have already purchased your virtual
    currency and have stored it in an e-wallet. Here are the steps you need to take:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Step 1.</strong> Log in to your favorite crypto or bitcoin casino and visit the cashier
    </li>
    <li><strong>Step 2.</strong>&nbsp;Select a cryptocurrency</li>
    <li><strong>Step 3.</strong>&nbsp;Choose a crypto wallet</li>
    <li><strong>Step 4.</strong>&nbsp;Enter the amount you want to deposit</li>
  </ul>
  <p>If this is your first deposit, make sure to accept the welcome bonus, if offered. Finally, enjoy
    playing your chosen selection of bitcoin games.</p>
  <h3>Making a bitcoin casino instant withdrawal</h3>
  <p>Making an instant withdrawal at a bitcoin casino is just as simple as with any other casino. Before
    you make a withdrawal at a crypto casino, you’ll need to make sure that you’ve fulfilled any wagering
    requirements, especially if you’ve used your bonus funds. Withdrawing funds to your wallet is as easy
    as the following.</p>
  <ul>
    <li><b>Step 1. </b>Visit the cashier and choose your preferred method of withdrawal</li>
    <li><strong>Step 2. </strong>Enter the amount you wish to withdraw and confirm the withdrawal request
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p>Keep in mind that all bitcoin casino withdrawals are not instant, so make sure the casino you’re
    playing at has this functionality if it’s something you want.</p>

<amp-img alt="Bitcoin Casino Fact 3" class="mt-lg-20 mt-10 mb-lg-40 mb-40" src="/images/icons/Bitcoin-Casino-Fact-3-3.svg" layout="responsive" height="0.15" width="1"></amp-img>

  <h2>Most popular games at bitcoin casinos</h2>
  <p>Crypto gambling games aren’t that different from those you’ll find at other online casinos. Of
    course, not all casinos offer the same library of titles. Generally, however, you can expect to use
    your crypto coins to play the most popular casino games, such as:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Slots</li>
    <li>Video <a href="/">poker</a></li>
    <li>Blackjack</li>
    <li>Roulette</li>
    <li>Craps</li>
    <li>Live casino</li>
    <li>Dice</li>
    <li>VR Casino</li>
  </ul>


  <h2>Mobile bitcoin casinos</h2>
  <p>It’s commonplace these days for almost everything on the web to offer a mobile version. Fortunately,
    that includes Bitcoin gambling sites. While many casinos have developed apps you can download onto
    your mobile device, many others have taken the mobile-optimized approach to their website. What this
    means is that you can play numerous bitcoin games from the casino’s portfolio on your mobile browser
    while saving space on your phone that would otherwise be taken up by an app.</p>
  <p>If you play on a mobile device, you’ll, of course, need to deposit your virtual coins and be able to
    access your digital wallet. So you should download your wallet onto your device, or at least know your
    key, for when you make a deposit. If you started off using your desktop but want to play the same
    casino using your phone, there’s no need to make another deposit, the wallet and bonuses used on the
    desktop can generally be used on mobile just the same.</p>


  <h2>Provably fair casinos</h2>
  <p>A provably fair bitcoin casino confirms the fairness of a game in real time, which makes checking via
    manual auditing unnecessary. <strong>All casinos listed on our sites have provably fair
      games.</strong></p>
  <h3>How to know if a casino is provably fair</h3>
  <p>When starting a provably fair game, you’ll receive a hashed seed number, and you’ll have the ability
    to add your own seed. Once the <a href="/">bet</a> has been played, you will be given
    the seed that was used in the bet. If the hash wasn’t touched in any way, the game can be considered
    to be fair and random.</p>
  <p>A provably fair game allows you to verify that a game’s outcome is random and untouched. It’s a
    clever and technologically advanced way of ensuring that a game provides a <strong>fair and safe
      experience for crypto players</strong>. When provably fair games have been established, it enhances
    fairness, transparency, and trust. It’s just one of the many things we love about Bitcoin casinos.</p>


  <h2>Step by step: how to get started at a bitcoin casino</h2>
  <p>Now that you have all the information you need, it’s easy to start playing at a crypto casino. Just
    follow these three steps:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Step 1. </strong>The first thing you need to do is find an exchange to buy your virtual
      coins from. There are a number of reputable exchanges that provide cryptocurrency services, so
      choose one and make your purchase. We just want to make you aware that different exchanges offer
      different cryptocurrencies, so if you have a preference for a coin such as <a
        href="/">Litecoin</a>, please find an exchange that
      sells that particular coin.</li>
    <li><strong>Step 2.</strong> Once you’ve purchased your coins, you’ll need to find a crypto wallet to
      store your coins in and keep them safe. In the meantime, you can keep your coins in the exchange
      from which your coins were purchased. Longer-term, however, you should store your coins in your own
      wallet, in order to have more control over your currency.<br>
      Some crypto and bitcoin casinos sell virtual coins, which means that you can go straight to the
      casino. You can even do so just before you’re ready to start playing. Just make sure you know which
      casino you want to play at before you sign up and provide your payment details.</li>
    <li><strong>Step 3.</strong> Once you’ve bought your coins and are happy that you have them stored in
      a safe place, it’s time to choose your casino. Remember that we’ve already done the groundwork for
      you by providing the very best online crypto casinos. So you just need to decide which one is right
      for you, create your account, and have fun playing your favorite casino bitcoin games.</li>

You enter a few personal details, deposit funds, and get ready to enjoy the wide selection of games available to you. The only difference is that you aren’t required to enter as much information as you are with a conventional online casino because a crypto casino doesn’t require your financial information. So the sign-up process is actually quicker and easier.</p>{{</ qqa >}}

{{< qqe >}}How do I deposit using cryptocurrency at casinos?{{</ qqe >}}
{{< qqa >}}<p>The process to deposit money into your account using cryptocurrencies is fairly simple. The first step is to have an account on the site you’re looking to deposit.

<h3 class="mb-15">Who's Behind CryptoCasinos?</h3>
<p class="mb-15" style="color: #5a6a75;"><b>Jakob Olsson</b> <i>Editor-in-chief</i></p>
<p style="color: #5a6a75;">Since I stumbled upon the crypto space back in 2013 I've been obsessed with
  everything crypto-related. Back in 2016 I decided to combine my interest in crypto with my interest in
  gambling, and so CryptoCasinos was born.</p>
